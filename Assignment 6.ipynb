    "Reserved Keywords: You cannot use Python reserved keywords as variable names. For example, if, else, while, for, class, def, etc.\n",

    "Use lowercase for variable names (e.g., my_variable).\n",
    "Use underscores to separate words in variable names (snake_case).\n",
    "Use uppercase for constants (e.g., MY_CONSTANT).\n",

    "Camel Case for Class Names: Use CamelCase (capitalize the first letter of each word without spaces) for class names.\n",
    "Example: MyClass, PersonDetails\n",
    "UPPERCASE for Constants: Use uppercase letters with underscores to represent constants.\n",
    "Example: MAX_VALUE, PI_VALUE\n",
    "Descriptive and Meaningful Names: Choose variable names that are descriptive and convey the purpose of the variable.\n",
    "Avoid single-character names unless used in specific contexts like loop counters.\n",
    "Avoid Single Leading Underscore: A single leading underscore (_) is often used to indicate a \"weak internal use\" variable, but it's more of a convention and doesn't impact the variable's behavior.\n",
    "Avoid Single Trailing Underscore: A single trailing underscore is used to avoid conflicts with Python keywords.\n",
    "Use Plural for Collections: When naming variables that represent collections (lists, sets, dictionaries, etc.), use plural forms.\n",
    "Example: users, items, colors\n",
    "Avoid Overusing Abbreviations: While abbreviations can save characters, avoid overusing them, especially if it hinders readability.\n",
